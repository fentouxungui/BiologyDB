FBgn0003391	shg	UniProtKB	Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell adhesion proteins (PubMed:7958432). In connecting cells they preferentially interact with themselves in a homophilic manner; cadherins may thus contribute to the sorting of heterogeneous cell types (PubMed:7958432). During oogenesis, integral component of the guidance mechanisms that regulate the directional persistent collective migration of the border cell (BC) cluster through the nurse cells to the oocyte (PubMed:24855950, PubMed:30763317). Functions downstream of the two chemoattractant receptors, Pvr and Egfr, to promote BC adhesion between the leader cells of the migrating cluster and the surrounding nurse cells (PubMed:24855950). This adhesion increases Rac1 signaling in the leading cells, which in turn stabilizes DE-cadherin/DE-cadherin adhesions through the formation of forward-directed protrusions which attach/detach to the surrounding nurse cells in order to pull the cluster through the egg chamber to the oocyte (PubMed:24855950). Within the BC cluster, also promotes adhesion between BCs, and between BCs and polar cells which enables the lead BC to communicate direction to the other cells in the cluster, providing polarity to each individual cell and ensuring collective behavior (PubMed:24855950, PubMed:30763317). May function in cell intercalation in the lateral epidermis during germband extension (PubMed:24681004).

FBgn0035375	Pgant6	UniProtKB	Glycopeptide transferase involved in O-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis, which catalyzes the transfer of an N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residue to an already glycosylated peptide (PubMed:12829714). In contrast to other proteins of the family, it does not act as a peptide transferase that transfers GalNAc onto serine or threonine residue on the protein receptor, but instead requires the prior addition of a GalNAc on a peptide before adding additional GalNAc moieties (PubMed:12829714). Some peptide transferase activity is however not excluded, considering that its appropriate peptide substrate may remain unidentified (PubMed:12829714). Prefers the diglycosylated Muc5AC-3/13 as substrate (PubMed:12829714).

FBgn0035397	PAN3	UniProtKB	Regulatory subunit of the poly(A)-nuclease (PAN) deadenylation complex, one of two cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylases involved in general and miRNA-mediated mRNA turnover. PAN specifically shortens poly(A) tails of RNA and the activity is stimulated by poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). PAN deadenylation is followed by rapid degradation of the shortened mRNA tails by the CCR4-NOT complex. Deadenylated mRNAs are then degraded by two alternative mechanisms, namely exosome-mediated 3'-5' exonucleolytic degradation, or deadenylation-dependent mRNA decaping and subsequent 5'-3' exonucleolytic degradation by XRN1. PAN3 acts as a positive regulator for PAN activity, recruiting the catalytic subunit PAN2 to mRNA via its interaction with RNA and PABP, and to miRNA targets via its interaction with GW182 family proteins.

FBgn0028484	Ack	UniProtKB	Non-receptor tyrosine-protein and serine/threonine-protein kinase that is implicated in diverse biological functions such as cell survival, cell differentiation, cell growth and proliferation (PubMed:11997505, PubMed:18816840, PubMed:22615583, PubMed:23562806, PubMed:25223282, PubMed:27462444). Phosphorylates SH3PX1 and ex (PubMed:22615583, PubMed:11773052, PubMed:27462444). Phosphorylates SH3PX1 predominantly on 'Tyr-56', which likely promotes the recruitment of SH3PX1 to an axonal guidance receptor complex that includes dock and Dscam; because phosphorylation of SH3PX1 increases its interaction with the complex member dock while decreasing its interaction with the actin cytoskeleton modulator WASp (PubMed:11773052). In the wing and eye, promotes tissue growth, and during embryogenesis coordinates cell shape changes required for correct dorsal closure (PubMed:22615583, PubMed:27462444, PubMed:18816840). Functions in the negative regulation of the Hippo/SWH (Sav/Wts/Hpo) signaling pathway by enhancing yki activity thereby promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (PubMed:22615583, PubMed:27462444). This is accomplished, at least in part, by phosphorylating ex thereby reducing its ability to efficiently activate the Hippo signaling cascade (PubMed:27462444). In the eye disk, wing disk and possibly spermatids, inhibits programmed cell death induced by hid and rpr through a mechanism that is independent of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway (PubMed:22615583). Essential for male and female fertility (PubMed:22615583, PubMed:23562806). During oogenesis required for the correct temporal assembly, and consequently the catalytic activity of long Ctps filaments (cytoophidium) in the germline nurse cells, likely by phosphorylating an unidentified substrate that is essential for linking individual Ctps filaments into large, catalytically active assemblies (PubMed:25223282).

FBgn0020255	Ran	UniProtKB	GTPase involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, participating both to the import and the export from the nucleus of proteins and RNAs. Switches between a cytoplasmic GDP- and a nuclear GTP-bound state by nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis. Nuclear import receptors such as importin beta bind their substrates only in the absence of GTP-bound RAN and release them upon direct interaction with GTP-bound RAN, while export receptors behave in the opposite way. Thereby, RAN controls cargo loading and release by transport receptors in the proper compartment and ensures the directionality of the transport. Interaction with RANBP1 induces a conformation change in the complex formed by XPO1 and RAN that triggers the release of the nuclear export signal of cargo proteins. RAN (GTP-bound form) triggers microtubule assembly at mitotic chromosomes and is required for normal mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. Required for normal progress through mitosis (By similarity). GTP-bound Ran modulates both spindle and nuclear envelope assembly, supporting a role during mitosis (PubMed:12121620).

Largest and catalytic component of RNA polymerase II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Forms the polymerase active center together with the second largest subunit. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. It is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. RPB1 is part of the core element with the central large cleft, the clamp element that moves to open and close the cleft and the jaws that are thought to grab the incoming DNA template. At the start of transcription, a single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned within the central active site cleft of Pol II. A bridging helix emanates from RPB1 and crosses the cleft near the catalytic site and is thought to promote translocation of Pol II by acting as a ratchet that moves the RNA-DNA hybrid through the active site by switching from straight to bent conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. During transcription elongation, Pol II moves on the template as the transcript elongates. Elongation is influenced by the phosphorylation status of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II largest subunit (RPB1), which serves as a platform for assembly of factors that regulate transcription initiation, elongation, termination and mRNA processing (By similarity).

FBgn0035649	PXo	UniProtKB	Inorganic ion transporter that mediates phosphate ion export across the cell membrane (PubMed:37138087). Plays a major role in phosphate homeostasis, preventing intracellular phosphate accumulation and possible calcium phosphate precipitation, ultimately preserving calcium signaling (PubMed:37138087). The molecular mechanism of phosphate transport, whether electrogenic, electroneutral or coupled to other ions, remains to be elucidated (By similarity). Binds inositol hexakisphosphate (Ins6P) and similar inositol polyphosphates, such as 5-diphospho-inositol pentakisphosphate (5-InsP7), important intracellular signaling molecules involved in regulation of phosphate flux (By similarity). In enterocytes and differentiating progenitors of the gut, promotes the biogenesis and maintenance of organelles called PXo bodies that store intracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi), and also regulates Cka-JNK mediated tissue homeostasis in response to Pi availability in these tissues (PubMed:37138087). Under conditions of adequate Pi, transports Pi into PXo bodies which convert and store the Pi in the form of phospholipids (PubMed:37138087). It also inhibits Cka at the post-transcriptional level to prevent Cka-bsk/JNK mediated cell proliferation (PubMed:37138087). Upon Pi starvation, Pxo expression is down-regulated resulting in the PXo bodies decreasing in phospholipid content until they undergo lysosomal/autophagosomal degradation and release the stored Pi back into the cytosol for use by the cell (PubMed:37138087). Decrease in Pxo expression also activates the Cka protein, which moves to the nucleus to activate bsk/JNK which then induces nearby progenitor cells to proliferate and form new absorptive cells, probably helping the organism to cope with the nutrient deficiency by maximizing absorption of dietary Pi (PubMed:37138087).

Functions downstream of Dsor1/MEK to positively regulate the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway (PubMed:27552662). Likely to modulate the pathway during various cellular and developmental processes including rl/MAPK activation by the receptors InR, Egfr and sevenless/sev (PubMed:27552662). Functions in the post-translational stabilization of rl/MAPK levels in a mechanism that is independent of rl activity and opposes the activity of the E2 enzyme Unc6 and the putative E3 ligases poe, Ufd4 and Kcmf1, which mediate the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of rl (PubMed:27552662). During eye development it may also act downstream of rl/MAPK to negatively regulate the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway by stabilizing the transcriptional repressor ttk and consequently inhibiting photoreceptor cell development (PubMed:18160715). This suggests that at least during eye development, it may act in both the positive and negative regulation of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway to mediate the development of different cell types (PubMed:18160715, PubMed:27552662). Positively regulates border follicle cell migration during oogenesis by mediating the deubiquitination and stabilization of slbo (PubMed:10949024).

Within this mechanism Rab3-GTP acts, directly or indirectly, to inhibit the progression of synaptic homeostasis, and Rab3-GAP functions to inactivate this action of Rab3-GTP (Probable). The Rab3GAP complex, acts as a GEF for Rab18 by promoting the conversion of inactive Rab18-GDP to the active form Rab18-GTP (By similarity). Regulates autophagy as part of a Rab3GAP-Rab18 module (PubMed:32248620). Once Rab18 is activated by the GEF Rab3GAP complex, the Rab3GAP-Rab18 module localizes to autophagosomes, and regulates autolysosome formation and maturation together with the Rab18 interacting effector, the PI3K/Vps34 Complex I (PubMed:32248620).

FBgn0000146	aub	UniProtKB	Acts via the piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) metabolic process, which mediates the repression of transposable elements during meiosis by forming complexes composed of piRNAs and Piwi proteins and governs the methylation and subsequent repression of transposons. Directly binds piRNAs, a class of 24 to 30 nucleotide RNAs that are generated by a Dicer-independent mechanism and are primarily derived from transposons and other repeated sequence elements. In ovary, associates predominantly with antisense piRNAs that contain uridine at their 5' end. In testis, associates with Su(Ste) antisense piRNAs (most abundant class of piRNAs found in complex with aub in testes) and negatively regulates Ste expression, most likely by cleaving its transcripts. Also in testis, may repress translation of vas when associated with a piRNA derived from chromosome X, termed AT-chX-1, whose sequence shows strong complementarity to vas mRNA. Aub-piRNA complexes from ovary and testis possess RNA cleavage activity. Involved in telomere regulation by repressing specialized telomeric retroelements HeT-A and TART; Drosophila telomeres being maintained by transposition of specialized telomeric retroelements. Also involved in telomeric trans-silencing, a repression mechanism by which a transposon or a transgene inserted in subtelomeric heterochromatin has the capacity to repress in trans, in the female germline, a homologous transposon, or transgene located in euchromatin. Involved in the suppression of meiotic drive of sex chromosomes and autosomes. Involved in transposon silencing in the adult brain. Required for dorsal-ventral as well as anterior-posterior patterning of the egg. Required during oogenesis for primordial germ cell formation and activation of RNA interference. During early oogenesis, required for osk mRNA silencing and polarization of the microtubule cytoskeleton. During mid-oogenesis, required for osk mRNA localization to the posterior pole and efficient translation of osk and grk. During embryogenesis, required for posterior localization of nanos (nos) mRNA, independently of osk, and pole cell formation. Essential for the formation and/or structural integrity of perinuclear nuage particles. Required for the localization of Mael to the meiotic nuage. Forms a complex with smg, twin, AGO3 and specific piRNAs that targets nanos mRNA (and probably other maternal mRNAS) for deadenylation promoting its decay during early embryogenesis. (UniProtKB:O76922)
FBgn0004872	piwi	UniProtKB	Acts via the piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) metabolic process, which mediates the repression of transposable elements during meiosis by forming complexes composed of piRNAs and Piwi proteins and governs the methylation and subsequent repression of transposons (PubMed:26808625, PubMed:15817569, PubMed:17346786). Directly binds piRNAs, a class of 24 to 30 nucleotide RNAs that are generated by a Dicer-independent mechanism and are primarily derived from transposons and other repeated sequence elements (PubMed:16882972). In ovarian somatic cells, mediates silencing of transposable elements at the transcriptional level in a mael-dependent manner (PubMed:23159368, PubMed:28472469). Involved in silencing of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons in male germline (PubMed:15817569). In testis, regulates spermatogenesis together with Tudor-SN (PubMed:26808625). In germ cells, mediates silencing at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and is involved in the maintenance of populations of primary and secondary piRNAs. Piwi-mediated transcriptional silencing is accompanied by the formation of His3 trimethylated on 'Lys-10' (H3K9me3) associated euchromatin and heterochromatin (PubMed:23434410, PubMed:23392610, PubMed:24906153). In ovary, associates predominantly with antisense piRNAs that contain uridine at their 5' end. Association with sense piRNAs is also observed but to a lesser extent. Mediates a somatic signaling mechanism required for the maintenance of germline stem cells to produce and maintain a daughter germline stem cell (PubMed:9851978, PubMed:10631171, PubMed:9199372, PubMed:16949822). It is not essential for the further differentiation of the committed daughter cell (PubMed:9851978). Acts cell autonomously to promote germline stem cell division (PubMed:9851978, PubMed:10631171). Its role in stem cell maintenance does not seem to require nuclear localization. Required maternally for the posterior localization of osk and vas and for pole cell formation during oogenesis and early embryogenesis (PubMed:16949822). Together with Hop and Hsp83, mediates canalization, also known as developmental robustness, likely via epigenetic silencing of existing genetic variants and suppression of transposon-induced new genetic variation (PubMed:21186352). Shows RNA cleavage activity, although is not required for any of its known functions (PubMed:9199372, PubMed:16882972, PubMed:23297219). In the ovaries, forms a complex with nxf2, Panx and Nxt1 which acts as effectors of cotranscriptional transposon silencing (PubMed:31368590, PubMed:31384064). (UniProtKB:Q9VKM1)

FBgn0027505	Rab3-GAP	UniProtKB	Regulatory subunit of the Rab3 GTPase-activating (Rab3GAP) complex composed of Rab3-GAP and Rab3GAP1, which has both GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity towards Rab3, and guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity towards Rab18 (PubMed:21338884, PubMed:32248620). As part of the Rab3GAP complex, required for the rapid induction and sustained expression of synaptic homeostasis at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (PubMed:21338884). Also participates in the regulation of autophagy in tissues such as larval fat cells and adult muscles (PubMed:32248620). The Rab3GAP complex, acts as a GAP for Rab3 by converting active Rab3-GTP to the inactive form Rab3-GDP (PubMed:21338884). At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), forms a presynaptic signaling mechanism with Rab3 that regulates progression of synaptic homeostasis at a late stage of vesicle release (PubMed:21338884). Within this mechanism Rab3-GTP acts, directly or indirectly, to inhibit the progression of synaptic homeostasis, and Rab3-GAP functions to inactivate this action of Rab3-GTP (PubMed:21338884). The Rab3GAP complex, acts as a GEF for Rab18 by promoting the conversion of inactive Rab18-GDP to the active form Rab18-GTP (By similarity). Regulates autophagy as part of a Rab3GAP-Rab18 module (PubMed:32248620). Once Rab18 is activated by the GEF Rab3GAP complex, the Rab3GAP-Rab18 module localizes to autophagosomes, and regulates autolysosome formation and maturation together with the Rab18 interacting effector, the PI3K/Vps34 Complex I (PubMed:32248620).

FBgn0021796	mTor	UniProtKB	Promotes cell and tissue growth, maintains tissue homeostatis and controls responses to environmental stress and aging (PubMed:11069885, PubMed:11069888, PubMed:19211682, PubMed:19225150). Regulates growth during animal development by coupling growth factor signaling to nutrient availability (PubMed:11069888). Central regulators of autophagy (PubMed:18604198, PubMed:19225150). May be involved in atg1 phosphorylation (PubMed:19225150). May also be involved, directly or indirectly, in the control of neuronal function (PubMed:15454083). Phosphorylates S6K/p70S6K, in vitro (PubMed:11069888). May regulate the activity of S6K (PubMed:11069885). Overexpression inhibits growth and reduces cell size (PubMed:14505573). Affects the timing of neuronal cell differentiation (PubMed:15454083). Hyperactivation of the signaling leads to accelerated differentiation, whereas inhibition of the signaling retards differentiation (PubMed:15454083). Thus, in addition to controlling growth of the cell in which it resides, it can also influence growth of distant cells and organs during development via a humoral mechanism (PubMed:14505573). As part of the TORC1 complex regulates energy homeostasis and promotes certain aspects of larval growth by negatively regulating REPTOR (PubMed:25920570). REPTOR functions downstream of TORC1 to regulate the expression of stress response genes in response to TORC1 inhibition resulting from nutrient deprivation (PubMed:25920570). When TORC1 activity is high it phosphorylates REPTOR which inhibits its recruitment into the nucleus and antagonizes their function (PubMed:25920570). This function is essential under normal feeding conditions to promote TORC1-dependent growth during larval development and, in adults and larvae to prevent the REPTOR-dependent expression of nutrient stress response genes (PubMed:25920570). In short, during development, it primarily controls growth, whereas in the adult, where there is relatively little growth, it controls aging and other aspects of nutrient-related physiology (PubMed:11069885, PubMed:11069888, PubMed:19211682, PubMed:19225150).

Essential for migration of the primordial midgut cells and for maintaining, but not establishing, cell polarity in the midgut epithelium. Can only partially compensate for the loss of beta-PS integrin during primordial midgut cell migration. The two beta subunits mediate midgut migration by distinct mechanisms: beta-PS requires rhea/Talin and beta-nu does not. Integrin alpha-PS3/beta-nu is required for effective phagocytosis of apoptotic cells during embryonic development and for the phagocytic elimination of S.aureus by mediating the binding of S.aureus peptidoglycan to larval hemocytes, which probably activates a signaling pathway involving Rac1 and Rac2. Not required for the production of antimicrobial peptides during S.aureus. Upon activation by LanA, integrin alpha-PS3/beta-nu activates Fak in presynapsis to suppress neuromuscular junction (NMJ) growth during larval development and during low crawling activity, but not during higher-crawling conditions.

FBgn0019624	COX5A	UniProtKB	Component of the cytochrome c oxidase, the last enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain which drives oxidative phosphorylation. The respiratory chain contains 3 multisubunit complexes succinate dehydrogenase (complex II, CII), ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome b-c1 complex, complex III, CIII) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV, CIV), that cooperate to transfer electrons derived from NADH and succinate to molecular oxygen, creating an electrochemical gradient over the inner membrane that drives transmembrane transport and the ATP synthase. Cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water. Electrons originating from reduced cytochrome c in the intermembrane space (IMS) are transferred via the dinuclear copper A center (CU(A)) of subunit 2 and heme A of subunit 1 to the active site in subunit 1, a binuclear center (BNC) formed by heme A3 and copper B (CU(B)).

FBgn0003567	su(Hw)	UniProtKB	Component of the gypsy chromatin insulator complex which is required for the function of the gypsy chromatin insulator and other endogenous chromatin insulators. Chromatin insulators are regulatory elements which establish independent domains of transcriptional activity within eukaryotic genomes. Insulators have two defining properties; they can block the communication between an enhancer and a promoter when placed between them and can also buffer transgenes from position effect variegation (PEV). Insulators are proposed to structure the chromatin fiber into independent domains of differing transcriptional potential by promoting the formation of distinct chromatin loops. This chromatin looping may involve the formation of insulator bodies, where homotypic interactions between individual subunits of the insulator complex could promote the clustering of widely spaced insulators at the nuclear periphery. Within the gypsy insulator complex, this protein binds specifically to a region of the gypsy element located 3' of the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), and may also mediate interaction with other endogenous insulators at sites distinct from those recognized by Cp190.

Acts downstream of Notch signaling to specify the fate of the SOP (sensory organ precursor) cells and their progeny, probably via the sina-mediated proteasomal degradation of ttk. Its restricted pattern of expression, upon Notch and Ras signaling pathways, suggests that it acts as a key determinant in E3 complexes to trigger protein proteolysis in appropriate cells.

FBgn0033901	O-fut1	UniProtKB	Catalyzes the reaction that attaches fucose through an O-glycosidic linkage to a conserved serine or threonine residue found in the consensus sequence C2-X(4,5)-[S/T]-C3 of EGF domains, where C2 and C3 are the second and third conserved cysteines (PubMed:12909620). Specifically uses GDP-fucose as donor substrate and proper disulfide pairing of the substrate EGF domains is required for fucose transfer (By similarity). Plays a crucial role in Notch signaling (PubMed:12917292, PubMed:12909620, PubMed:17329366). Initial fucosylation of Notch/N by O-fut1 generates a substrate for Fringe/Fng, an acetylglucosaminyltransferase that can then extend the fucosylation on the Notch EGF repeats (PubMed:12909620). This extended fucosylation is required for optimal ligand binding and canonical NOTCH signaling induced by Delta/Dl or Serrate/Ser (PubMed:12909620, PubMed:12917292). Also required for the transport of Notch/N to the early endosome (PubMed:17329366). (UniProtKB:Q9V6X7)

FBgn0013672	mt:ATPase6	FlyBase Gene Snapshot	mitochondrial ATPase subunit 6 (mt:ATPase6) encodes a mitochondrial inner transmembrane protein that is key for oxidative phosphorylation. It couples hydrogen ion transport to ATP synthesis functioning as part of the ATP synthase.
FBgn0013676	mt:CoIII	UniProtKB	Component of the cytochrome c oxidase, the last enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain which drives oxidative phosphorylation. The respiratory chain contains 3 multisubunit complexes succinate dehydrogenase (complex II, CII), ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome b-c1 complex, complex III, CIII) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV, CIV), that cooperate to transfer electrons derived from NADH and succinate to molecular oxygen, creating an electrochemical gradient over the inner membrane that drives transmembrane transport and the ATP synthase. Cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water. Electrons originating from reduced cytochrome c in the intermembrane space (IMS) are transferred via the dinuclear copper A center (CU(A)) of subunit 2 and heme A of subunit 1 to the active site in subunit 1, a binuclear center (BNC) formed by heme A3 and copper B (CU(B)). The BNC reduces molecular oxygen to 2 water molecules using 4 electrons from cytochrome c in the IMS and 4 protons from the mitochondrial matrix. (UniProtKB:P00417)

FBgn0046706	Haspin	UniProtKB	Serine/threonine-protein kinase that phosphorylates histone H3 at 'Thr-4' (H3T3ph) during mitosis and interphase (PubMed:32750047). Function is essential for chromosome organization during mitosis and genome organization in interphase cells, thus playing a functional role in gene regulation (PubMed:32750047). During mitosis, may act through H3T3ph to both position and modulate activation of AURKB and other components of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) at centromeres to ensure proper chromatid cohesion, metaphase alignment and normal progression through the cell cycle (By similarity). During interphase, associates with the cohesion complex and mediates pds5 binding to chromatin to ensure correct sister chromatid cohesion, chromatin organization, and also functions with Pds5-cohesin to modify Polycomb-dependent homeotic transformations (PubMed:32750047). Function during interphase is required for insulator activity, nuclear compaction, heterochromatin-induced position-effect variegation and PcG-mediated pairing-sensitive silencing (PubMed:32750047).

Within the RQC complex, Clbn/NEMF specifically binds stalled 60S ribosomal subunits by recognizing an exposed, nascent chain-conjugated tRNA moiety (PubMed:31378462). Following binding to stalled 60S ribosomal subunits, Clbn/NEMF mediates CAT tailing by recruiting alanine-charged tRNA to the A-site and directing the elongation of stalled nascent chains independently of mRNA or 40S subunits, leading to non-templated C-terminal alanine extensions (CAT tails) (By similarity). On mitochondrial surface, plays a role in mitochondrial-stress induced translational termination impairment and protein carboxyl terminal extension (MISTERMINATE) (PubMed:31378462). Plays a role in regulating nuclear transport possibly through directly binding to both emb and cargo proteins (PubMed:16103875). Plays a role in the regulation of G1-to-S cell cycle transition (PubMed:30231800). Regulates S phase checkpoint by antagonizing E2F1 activity (PubMed:30231800). Together with hid and tefu/ATM, plays a role in DNA damage-induced apoptosis through both p53-dependent and -independent activity (PubMed:22964637). Plays an essential role in the regulation of mitochondrial structure and redox state in enterocytes which is essential for the control of intestinal stem cells proliferation and intestinal homeostasis (PubMed:33057338).

FBgn0263740	eIF2gamma	UniProtKB	As a subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 eIF2, involved in the early steps of protein synthesis. In the presence of GTP, eIF-2 forms a ternary complex with initiator tRNA Met-tRNAi and then recruits the 40S ribosomal complex and initiation factors eIF-1, eIF-1A and eIF-3 to form the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC), a step that determines the rate of protein translation. The 43S PIC binds to mRNA and scans downstream to the initiation codon, where it forms a 48S initiation complex by codon-anticodon base pairing. This leads to the displacement of eIF-1 to allow GTPase-activating protein (GAP) eIF-5-mediated hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP. Hydrolysis of GTP and release of Pi, which makes GTP hydrolysis irreversible, causes the release of the eIF-2-GDP binary complex from the 40S subunit, an event that is essential for the subsequent joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit to form an elongation-competent 80S ribosome. In order for eIF-2 to recycle and catalyze another round of initiation, the GDP bound to eIF-2 must be exchanged with GTP by way of a reaction catalyzed by GDP-GTP exchange factor (GEF) eIF-2B.

FBgn0289678	pal	FlyBase Gene Snapshot	paternal loss (pal) encodes a male-germline specific protein which localizes to spermatid nuclei during the histone-to-protamine transition. pal protein is required for the eviction of H3 and H4 histones after the removal of H2A and H2B during spermiogenesis.
FBgn0289712	cpa	FlyBase Gene Snapshot	capping protein alpha (cpa) encodes an actin-binding protein that, along with the product of cpb, binds to the fast growing ends of actin filaments to restrict the addition or loss of actin monomers. It limits the nuclear translocation of the Hippo pathway mediator encoded by yki and restricts JNK signaling. It maintains epithelial integrity and controls the balance between proliferation and apoptosis in the wing imaginal disc. It plays important roles during oogenesis, as well as maintaining neuronal homeostasis.
